\section{Equations}
The user does not need to do anything special to tag equations: all that really
needs to happen is handled in the \texttt{required-config.sty} file. The idea is
to keep the user away from this file so they don't have to think about it.

For each direction $\ell \in \mathcal{L}$, we define the bilinear form
$t^\ell_h: \mathbb{V}_h \times \mathbb{V}_h \to \mathbb{R}$ via... The Basel
problem:
\begin{equation*}
  \sum\nolimits_{n\in \mathbb{Z}^+} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6} \approx 1.6449
\end{equation*}

A matrix equation:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \begin{pmatrix}c&d\\a&b
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
