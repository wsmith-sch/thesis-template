\chapter*{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}

\indent This section is also optional, and limited to four pages. It
must follow the Dedication Page (or Abstract, if there's no
Dedication). If listing preliminary pages in Table of Contents,
include Acknowledgments. This heading
(\MakeUppercase{Acknowledgments}) is bold if major headings are bold.
It should be in same type size and style as text. As does the
vertical spacing, paragraph style, and margins.
